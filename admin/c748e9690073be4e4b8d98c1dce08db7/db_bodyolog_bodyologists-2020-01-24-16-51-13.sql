A healthy lifestyle and carry out simple oral hygiene every day will allow us to enjoy healthy teeth and gums. To do this, we must take into account both the recommendations of the specialists and a few simple steps for proper oral hygiene. We must clean every day in addition to the teeth, tongue, gums, palate and inside the cheeks. Performing this cleaning process periodically minimizes tartar, as well as preventing its formation. It also guarantees the integrity of the teeth and the good health of the gums, which should always be firm and pink and should not bleed during brushing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Keys to proper oral health: &lt;br /&gt; 1. Brush your teeth carefully.&lt;br /&gt; Ideally, do it after each meal, but if there is no other option, you should at least brush your teeth before going to sleep. The operation should last between two and three minutes and be done with small circular movements back and forth.&lt;br /&gt; 2. Clean the interdental spaces.&lt;br /&gt; If there is enough space, an interproximal brush or floss should be used. Both should be used at least once a day, preferably at night, in order to ensure the cleanliness of the side faces of the teeth and that there is no food left between them.&lt;br /&gt; 3. Do not forget the gums.&lt;br /&gt; And neither of the tongue, the palate and the inside of the cheeks, because they also accumulate the bacteria that can cause different dental disorders.&lt;br /&gt; 4. Renew your brush every two weeks or when the bristles start to look worn out. These, on the other hand, are preferable to be soft to prevent damage to tooth enamel.&lt;br /&gt; 5. Go to your dentist regularly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Because not even deep brushing completely eliminates dental plaque, mouth cleanings are recommended every six to twelve months. Likewise, you should check your teeth at least once a year. Specialists recommend professional oral hygiene -prophylaxis- every 4 or 6 months.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Additionally, minimize the intake of carbohydrates in your diet, avoid sweets and sugary drinks. Limit pecking between meals. Use mouthwashes to prevent the formation of bacterial plaque and provide fresh breath. Eradicate customs such as opening bottles, cutting heat with your teeth or chewing ice. The teeth can splinter and even, if there is a fracture, damage the nerve and compromise the stability of the tooth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Finally, saliva plays a fundamental role in our dental health. Not only does it collaborate in the chewing and swallowing process, but it regulates the pH level of the mouth and prevents carious formations. To achieve optimal levels of segregation, it is advisable to stay hydrated and drink plenty of water - at least 1.5 liters a day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;','','THE VALUE OF IMPECCABLE DENTAL HEALTH','Maintaining proper oral hygiene can help prevent health problems.

It is the moisturizer par excellence, the healthiest and the most natural. So good hydration is important for our physical and mental health. Our brain is made up of 90% water, 83% blood, 75% muscle mass, and 22% bones, so we can say that water is one of the main components of the human body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;We must learn to listen to the body when it asks for water. To understand that the sensation of thirst is the way you have to ask us for liquid. Maintaining an adequate level of hydration is essential for survival, health, physical and mental performance. Water should even be ingested, without the absence of thirst.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In order to hydrate our body, it is necessary to consume at least 2 liters of water a day, but other foods, such as fruit, vegetables or drinks such as infusions, soft drinks, juices, dairy, also provide us with the water we need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One of the benefits of staying hydrated is that this facilitates the oxygenation of brain cells and allows the brain to remain active to perform all its actions. Dehydration in the brain can cause serious health problems. With good hydration, the elimination of accumulated toxins is facilitated. Thanks to this, an adequate metabolic function is obtained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Water rehydrates your skin. One of the main benefits and reasons why you should drink water is that it is your greatest ally to show and have a shiny skin, especially if you are very exposed to the sun or exercise. It lubricates joints. In addition to being one of the best skin rehydrators, water consumption lubricates your joints and prevents wear and cramps when you exercise or activities that require a lot of physical effort. It prevents acne. Water consumption is one of the best allies when it comes to taking care of your face and complexion as it prevents the appearance of acne by maintaining the correct amount of fat on the skin.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In addition to being of great benefit and importance for your skin, water has other impacts on your overall health such as the brain, organs, stomach, care, and weight control, etc. It is only important to keep in mind that you should consume the amount of water your body needs, so there is no exact recipe for how much in liters you should consume daily, but always try to make it very often.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is important to maintain adequate hydration, especially in hot weather that more water is lost due to sweating.

The answer is quite simple: because it is free health insurance. The only cost you have is the time you dedicate. Self-care prevents diseases, immunizes you, and protects your health, both physically and psychologically. The challenge in today&#039;s society is for the individual to move from a passive attitude, from a care recipient to an active or proactive one, from the search for well-being and responsibility for their own health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;When we prioritize work, domestic or interpersonal objectives for too long, leaving aside our personal well-being, our body begins to warn us that we are overloading ourselves. It does so through symptoms of physical discomfort that are common in people with stress, such as:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;- Headaches or brain fog.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;- Nausea, diarrhea, gas.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;- Muscle pain, muscle spasms, weakness.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p2&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;- Palpitations, choking sensation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Among the practices for self-care are: adequate feeding to the needs, hygienic measures, stress management, skills to establish social relationships and solve interpersonal problems, exercise and physical activity required, ability to adapt the consumption of medications, monitoring of prescriptions of health, safe sexual behaviors, recreation and free time management, dialogue, favorable adaptations to changes in context, information search and management of different signs and symptoms in diseases.

Performing physical activity is not only good for weight loss, but it also improves heart and lung capacity, helps prevent and even treat chronic diseases (such as hypertension, cancer, and depression) and lowers cholesterol. In addition, it improves the quality of sleep and has a regulatory effect of stress, so it reduces anxiety and stabilizes mood.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Sleep well. Sleep is an indicator of health. Some cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic diseases are linked to sleep quality. Try to sleep for the necessary time, but remember that to stay healthy we need both quantity and quality.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Reduce stress. A constant state of stress causes us to lose muscle mass and accumulate more fat; It raises blood pressure, increases blood cholesterol and lowers levels of good cholesterol or HDL. This translates into body weight gain and, therefore, an increased risk of chronic non-communicable diseases. Fight stress by getting a massage, practicing yoga or meditation.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Periodic medical checkup. To prevent and to heal you.

Do recreational activities that allow you to have fun and distract yourself. Visit different places, take a walk through nature and take the opportunity to pamper yourself with those you love most. Remember that health is not the absence of diseases, but the perfect balance between your body, mind, and spirit.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Nutritional changes. You can start with small changes that will have great effects on your health. Change processed meat, such as cold meats and fatty red meats, for lean and unprocessed meat, for poultry and even better, fatty fish such as salmon. Always serve 3-ounce servings and complement your plate with fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and small amounts of healthy fat, such as olive oil.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Remember that it is not enough to want to have a healthy lifestyle to prevent and combat body diseases, it is also necessary to take care of mental health and the new challenges of modern life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;','','STEPS THAT LEAD TO A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE','The World Health Organization published in its most recent report the diseases that cause the most deaths in the world, all linked to unhealthy lifestyles: Car','',1,0,0,0,1,'2019-11-21 19:00:00','2019-11-21 22:21:23',0,'english',0),(7,'Beauty','','HOW TO MAKE YOUR TAN LAST LONGER','how-to-make-your-tan-last-longer','&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;To keep the tan longer it is also important to take care of the skin after a day at the beach or pool.

Therefore, it is important that in this new stage you try to take more vitamin D through of your diet you can find it in foods such as nuts, whole grains, legumes, etc.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;After sun lotion. If you have become accustomed to using lotion after sun exposure during the summer to relieve your skin from excess heat and soothe it, you can continue using it later even more. The after sun properties are very good and will allow your tan to last longer. These products usually have moisturizing and soothing assets and many, in addition, include ingredients that will help you keep the tan longer conceived precisely to nourish and repair the skin after sunbathing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Good nutrition. Another of the tricks to get a sunless tan or, at least, to accelerate it as much as possible when you do not have too much time, is to have an adequate diet. Try to keep your diet always rich in beta-carotene that helps your melanin to activate, as well as nourish yourself well with foods with vitamins C and E and Omega 3. You know, a lot of red fruit, citrus fruits, avocado and blue fish, among others delicacies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Hydration. When it comes to getting a tan that respects your skin, you can&#039;t miss a good dose of hydration. To preserve the tan and combat the dry effect of the sun it is very important to stay hydrated inside (drink water and natural juices) and outside (skin moisturizers). Apply any normal moisturizer you use after showering every time you feel dry skin. In addition to the normal moisturizer, opt for post-tanning creams, such as aloe vera, will improve its elasticity, and prevent premature appearance of wrinkles on the face and stretch marks on the body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;Now there are no excuses to wear a golden skin also in winter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;','','HOW TO MAKE YOUR TAN LAST LONGER','To keep the tan longer it is also important to take care of the skin after a day at the beach or pool.

A relaxing massage has proven to be an effective tool to relieve stress. Massage is a powerful treatment that also helps us replenish the innate reserves of vital energy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Another effective technique to manage stress is yoga, a discipline that combines a series of gentle movements and static poses with deep breathing. Most yoga classes end with relaxation poses, and there are certain types of yoga that emphasize slow and steady movements, breathing exercises and gentle stretching that are very beneficial for stress relief. Other properties include increased flexibility, strength, balance, and endurance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Listening to or playing music is a good stress reliever because it can provide a mental distraction, reduce muscle tension and decrease stress hormones. Turn up the volume and let your mind get absorbed by the music.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Exercising regularly is one of the best ways to manage stress.

For one, eating well will help you prevent future weight gain that might cause your unwanted body fat to return in the areas you&amp;rsquo;ve had treated. Your diet plays a role in determining not only how much fat your body has to store, but also how and where your body stores it. It&amp;rsquo;s important to eat the right kinds of fats and balance them with other nutrients like protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals to make sure your liposuction results don&amp;rsquo;t fade.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: rgb(131, 60, 11);&amp;quot;&amp;gt;The foods you eat can also help keep you feeling better about your body on a daily basis. For example, things like carbonated beverages or high-sodium foods can cause you to bloat and feel heavier or out of shape. Or, neglecting to eat foods that give you energy can leave you tired or moody, which can affect your confidence and motivation. Be sure to fill your diet with fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins and whole grains &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll keep your results looking good, and you&amp;rsquo;ll feel great while doing so.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong style=&amp;quot;color: rgb(131, 60, 11);&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Exercise regularly.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: rgb(131, 60, 11);&amp;quot;&amp;gt;After eating well, getting plenty of exercise helps the most with maintaining your liposuction results. Just like nutritious food, exercising keeps you looking good and feeling good. When you exercise, your body releases endorphins &amp;mdash; hormones that give you healthy energy and boost your mood. This often creates a positive feedback cycle: the more you exercise, the more you come to enjoy it, and the better shape you&amp;rsquo;ll be in.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: rgb(131, 60, 11);&amp;quot;&amp;gt;What&amp;rsquo;s more, exercise can do more than just maintain your liposuction results &amp;mdash; it can actually make them even better. Liposuction doesn&amp;rsquo;t affect your muscles, so if your goal is a fit, toned body, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to pair its fat-reducing abilities with strength-building workouts. And with less fat to pad your body, your fitness efforts will pay off more quickly than they used to. Most liposuction clients find that they&amp;rsquo;re more excited about working out after liposuction because they know they won&amp;rsquo;t be frustrated by stubborn fat any longer.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: rgb(131, 60, 11);&amp;quot;&amp;gt;ï»¿&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong style=&amp;quot;color: rgb(131, 60, 11);&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Stay hydrated.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: rgb(131, 60, 11);&amp;quot;&amp;gt;It might sound counterintuitive, but drinking the right amount of water helps reduce bloat due to water retention. If you stay properly hydrated, your body flushes extra water out of your system more effectively; instead of feeling frustrated by those few extra pounds of water weight, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to shed it easily and fully enjoy your post-liposuction figure.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong style=&amp;quot;color: rgb(131, 60, 11);&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color: rgb(131, 60, 11);&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Proper hydration also curbs cravings and hunger, helping you stay on track with a healthy diet by avoiding overeating. Try getting in the habit of drinking a full glass of water every morning when you wake up &amp;mdash; you might notice that you no longer need that extra mid-morning snack, or that you&amp;rsquo;re satisfied with a lighter, healthier breakfast. You can also carry a reusable bottle throughout the day to ensure you always have some water with you.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;ql-clipboard&amp;quot; contenteditable=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; tabindex=&amp;quot;-1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;ql-tooltip ql-hidden&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a class=&amp;quot;ql-preview&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;about:blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; data-formula=&amp;quot;e=mc^2&amp;quot; data-link=&amp;quot;quilljs.com&amp;quot; data-video=&amp;quot;Embed URL&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a class=&amp;quot;ql-action&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a class=&amp;quot;ql-remove&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;','','','','Plastic Surgery, Lymphatic Drainage, Liposuction',0,0,0,0,1,'2020-01-14 00:00:00','2020-01-14 10:45:03',0,'english',0);

CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND ARBITRATION&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIS SECTION CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH US.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Except if you opt-out as expressly permitted below, or except to the extent contrary to applicable law (&quot;Excluded Disputes&quot;), you hereby agree that all disputes between you and us (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with us, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, may, in our discretion, be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association&#039;s rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you hereby expressly waive trial by jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local &quot;small claims&quot; court, if permitted by that small claims court&#039;s rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. You agree that you shall not participate in any class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this Agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person&#039;s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the US Federal Arbitration Act, to the extent permissible. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.

If and to the extent the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then such preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2 role=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;XVI.

We are starting in South Florida and will expand nationwide in the United States and in other countries. Please share Bodyologists&trade; with your fellow professionals inviting them to get listed and help us to launch soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this another on-demand type of business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, Bodyologists&trade; will be membership-based. Professionals will pay a monthly flat fee to appear in the search results. We won&rsquo;t charge referral fees or commission fees for every service or every deal as other platforms do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professionals end up paying a high price using those platforms in order to get new customers. In our marketplace, professionals will be paying a fair monthly flat fee for unlimited flow of new customers, and flat fee to promote their special offers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professionals will get direct inquiries from prospects and do transactions directly with them, get more visitors to their websites, publish articles and improve their Google ranking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating and having a professional listing will always be free. After we implement the membership program, professionals who don&#039;t want to pay a monthly fee for appearing in the search results, still can create special deals and events for a small flat fee for each deal or event published. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the benefits of being listed in Bodyologists&trade;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The market is flooded with on-demand apps and coupon platforms that take a high percentage on each service, that control all the transactions and communication with customers, leaving the service provider powerless and frustrated. Providers end up paying a lot of money to these companies and working twice as hard to meet their financial goals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With Bodyologists&trade;, we want professionals to:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li role=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Connect with unlimited high-quality leads and have direct communication with them.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li role=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Charge what they want for their services.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li role=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Have total control of the transactions.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li role=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Promote their businesses and grow their customer base.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li role=&quot;listitem&quot;&gt;Improve their Google, Yahoo, Bing, and search engine rankings.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professionals will pay a monthly flat fee to have their profile get found by potential customers in the search results, and a flat fee for each deal or event they want to offer. Only certified and licensed professionals will be listed in Bodyologists&trade;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are you inviting professionals who are employees and working for someone else to get listed also in your marketplace? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professionals who work for someone else, rely on the marketing that their bosses implement in order to get new customers. For example, a massage therapist or an esthetician working at a spa relies on the business owner&#039;s marketing success and on the receptionist to get appointments with new customers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the other hand, new customers who call a spa to book a massage or a facial, for example, generally get an appointment without knowing anything about the massage therapist or the esthetician who is going to service them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With Bodyologists&trade;, we want professionals who are employees to get more appointments with new customers who want to book an appointment exclusively with them after they see their full bio, education, specialties, and experience listed in our marketplace. We want customers to be able to find the perfect professional they are looking for, whether the professional is an employee or self-employed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will you offer an affiliate marketing program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, we will offer an affiliate program after we start implementing our paid membership program. If you are an influencer with big followers on Instagram, or you are an educator, or manage Facebook Groups related to HealthCare, Fitness, Beauty or Wellness, you can benefit immensely by being one of the first people to join our affiliate marketing program. We are going to contact selected people to be our first affiliates. Stay tuned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have more questions not listed here and have some suggestions for Bodyologists&trade;, how can I contact you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Absolutely!
