<h1>Why am I charged tax?</h1><br />
Your purchase includes sales tax as required by law. 
We are required to collect sales tax on items that are shipped to, delivered to or picked up in states where sales tax is charged.
<br /><br />
We are also required to collect sales tax in all states where we have a physical presence. 
The tax amount reflects the applicable state and local rate.
